The 2015 MIT course Mathematics for Computer Science provides no solutions to problem sets and assignments. You may follow this course structure instead: <br><br> [2015 Online Lecture videos](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/proofs/) <br> [2015 Readings](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/readings/) <br> [2010 Recitation Problems with Solutions](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/recitations/) <br> [2005 Problem Sets/Assignments](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2005/assignments/) <br> _Optional: [2010 Video Lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/)_ <br><br> The problem sets and recitation problems from the older courses have solutions and mostly follow the same course structure. Occasionally, there may be a problem about something you have not done. In this case, use your judgement to decide if it is something that you can reasonably answer and consider returning to the problem at a later date. |

There known issues with quizzes/exams. In particular, some questions ask about content from future lectures. If in doubt, search the course forum ("Piazza") for guidance. <br>Specific issues: <br>Midterm, final question assumes knowledge of DHCP. You will need to complete unit 5 first. <br>The second quiz in 5-5 (HTTP): Do not include the initial page request. Minus 5 from your answer. (Search "5-5" in Piazza) |
